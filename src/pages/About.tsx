            I have an engineering degree in computer science from Polytech
            Grenoble. I enjoy programming, making and playing video games,
            hiking, and volleyball. When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer
            building projects, I'm probably chilling on a mountain with a cup of
            coffee.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            I started working in full-stack development because it's a field
            that offers diverse projects combining creativity and technical
            skills. I enjoy building tools that will make people's lives easier
            and optimize their work. To tackle this challenge most effectively,
            automation and designing suitable architecture are the keys. That's
            why DevOps and Cloud technologies also interest me greatly.
          </p>
          <p className="mt-4">
            I've always enjoyed learning new things, regardless of the subject,
            as long as it interests me. This habit helps me grasp the big
            picture and fulfill the requirements of my projects.
